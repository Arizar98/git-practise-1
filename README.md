Git practise project 1

You need a GitHub account. If you do not have one already, use the 'SIGN UP' button on the top right of this website to get a GitHub account.

If you do now know what git is or how to use git, start with the [git course](https://github.com/Opensource-Academy/git) first.

## For solo learners

Make a fork of this project.

Now make a fork from your fork of the project.

Clone the last fork you made to your machine.

Make a change or changes to some or a file in the project.

Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to push your changes to github.

Now create a pull request on the first fork you made, asking yourself to merge the changes you made in your fork's fork, into the first fork.

## For learners in pairs or with a teacher

Both parties make a fork of this project.

Now go to the other person's GitHub page and make a fork of the fork they just started.

Download the last fork you just made to your machines.

Make a change or changes to some or a file in the project.

Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to push your changes to github.

Now create a pull request on the first fork you made, asking the other person to merge the changes you made in your fork, into their fork.

## For 3 learners

If you do not have an even number of people, make one group of 3 and follow the same steps as described in the part for duos, now person A clones from person B, person B clones from C, and C clones from A again.

## Experiments

What happens if two people make changes to the same file?

After you accepted a pull request, clone your fork to your machine and make some changes. Now push back those changes to GitHub. How does the person who forked your project get your changes into their fork?
